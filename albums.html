		<h2>Albums</h2>
	<p class="album">Eminem started off his rap career with his debut album infinite which was released in 1996, but isn't avaliable on any platforms due to critics upon its original release. Following infinite was the comical The Slim Shady LP in 1999, which won the 2000 Grammy for the best rap album. In 2000 Eminem released his Marshall Mathers LP, two years later The Eminem Show which gave more of an insight to Marshall's real life difficulties. Following brought in a slightly more disappointing album titled "Encore" in 2004, he followed up with this album 5 years later with Relapse in 2009 proving he had so much more to give to this industry, Recovery followed at year later with a storytelling album and became the hightest selling album in 2010. 3 years later the second part of The Marshall Mathers LP was released with a record breaking song with Rap God, with the most lyrics in a song. Revival came out in 2017 and didn't last long in the listeners minds with a rare disappointing Eminem moment and recieved backlast. Fast forward a year later and Kamikaze dropped to come at everyone who doubted the proven rapper. And coming most recently was The Music to be murdered by Album which debuted at the number one on the Billboard 200 in 2020  </p>
